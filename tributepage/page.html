            <h1>Early Life</h1>
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Prabhavati Bose (née Dutt) and Janakinath Bose on 23 January 1897 in
                Cuttack—in what is today the state of Odisha in India, but was then the Orissa Division of Bengal
                Province in British India.[ag][ah] Prabhavati, or familiarly Mā jananī (lit. 'mother'), the anchor of
                family life, had her first child at age 14 and 13 children thereafter. Subhas was the ninth child and
                the sixth son.[59] Jankinath, a successful lawyer and government pleader,[58] was loyal to the
                government of British India and scrupulous about matters of language and the law. A self-made man from
                the rural outskirts of Calcutta, he had remained in touch with his roots, returning annually to his
                village during the pooja holidays.[60]

                Eager to join his five school-going older brothers, Subhas entered the Baptist Mission's Protestant
                European School in Cuttack in January 1902.[7] English was the medium of all instruction in the school,
                the majority of the students being European or Anglo-Indians of mixed British and Indian ancestry.[57]
                The curriculum included English—correctly written and spoken—Latin, the Bible, good manners, British
                geography, and British History; no Indian languages were taught.[57][7] The choice of the school was
                Janakinath's, who wanted his sons to speak flawless English with flawless intonation, believing both to
                be important for access to the British in India.[61] The school contrasted with Subhas's home, where
                only Bengali was spoken. At home, his mother worshipped the Hindu goddesses Durga and Kali, told stories
                from the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana, and sang Bengali religious songs.[7] From her, Subhas imbibed a
                nurturing spirit, looking for situations in which to help people in distress, preferring gardening
                around the house to joining in sports with other boys.[8] His father, who was reserved in manner and
                busy with professional life, was a distant presence in a large family, causing Subhas to feel he had a
                nondescript childhood.[62] Still, Janakinath read English literature avidly—John Milton, William Cowper,
                Matthew Arnold, and Shakespeare's Hamlet being among his favourites; several of his sons were to become
                English literature enthusiasts like him.</p>

            <h1>Indian National Congress</h1>
            <p>Subhas Bose, aged 24, arrived ashore in India at Bombay on the morning of 16 July 1921 and immediately
                set about arranging an interview with Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi, aged 51, was the leader of the
                non-cooperation movement that had taken India by storm the previous year and in a quarter-century would
                evolve to secure its independence.[ai][aj] Gandhi happened to be in Bombay and agreed to see Bose that
                afternoon. In Bose's account of the meeting, written many years later, he pilloried Gandhi with question
                after question.[83] Bose thought Gandhi's answers were vague, his goals unclear, his plan for achieving
                them not thought through.[83] Gandhi and Bose differed in this first meeting on the question of means-
                for Gandhi non-violent means to any end were non-negotiable; in Bose's thought, all means were
                acceptable in the service of anti-colonial ends.[83] They differed on the question of ends- Bose was
                attracted to totalitarian models of governance, which were anathematized by Gandhi.[84] According to
                historian Gordon, "Gandhi, however, set Bose on to the leader of the Congress and Indian nationalism in
                Bengal, C. R. Das, and in him Bose found the leader whom he sought."[83] Das was more flexible than
                Gandhi, more sympathetic to the extremism that had attracted idealistic young men such as Bose in
                Bengal.[83] Das launched Bose into nationalist politics.[83] Bose would work within the ambit of the
                Indian National Congress politics for nearly 20 years even as he tried to change its course.</p>

            <h1>Escape to NAZIs Germany</h1>
            <p>Bose's arrest and subsequent release set the scene for his escape to Nazi Germany, via Afghanistan and
                the Soviet Union. A few days before his escape, he sought solitude and, on this pretext, avoided meeting
                British guards and grew a beard. Late night 16 January 1941, the night of his escape, he dressed as a
                Pathan (brown long coat, a black fez-type coat and broad pyjamas) to avoid being identified. Bose
                escaped from under British surveillance from his Elgin Road house in Calcutta on the night of 17 January
                1941, accompanied by his nephew Sisir Kumar Bose, later reaching Gomoh Railway Station (now Netaji
                Subhas Chandra Bose Gomoh Station) in the then state of Bihar (now Jharkhand),
                India.[103][104][105][106]

                He journeyed to Peshawar with the help of the Abwehr, where he was met by Akbar Shah, Mohammed Shah and
                Bhagat Ram Talwar. Bose was taken to the home of Abad Khan, a trusted friend of Akbar Shah's. On 26
                January 1941, Bose began his journey to reach Russia through British India's North West frontier with
                Afghanistan. For this reason, he enlisted the help of Mian Akbar Shah, then a Forward Bloc leader in the
                North-West Frontier Province. Shah had been out of India en route to the Soviet Union, and suggested a
                novel disguise for Bose to assume. Since Bose could not speak one word of Pashto, it would make him an
                easy target of Pashto speakers working for the British. For this reason, Shah suggested that Bose act
                deaf and dumb, and let his beard grow to mimic those of the tribesmen. Bose's guide Bhagat Ram Talwar,
                unknown to him, was a Soviet agent.</p>

            <h1>Death</h1>
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose's death occurred from third-degree burns on 18 August 1945 after his overloaded
                Japanese plane crashed in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan).[124][41][4][5] However, many among his
                supporters, especially in Bengal, refused at the time, and have refused since, to believe either the
                fact or the circumstances of his death.[124][42][43] Conspiracy theories appeared within hours of his
                death and have thereafter had a long shelf life,[124][am] keeping alive various martial myths about
                Bose.[49]

                In Taihoku, at around 2:30 pm as the bomber with Bose on board was leaving the standard path taken by
                aircraft during take-off, the passengers inside heard a loud sound, similar to an engine
                backfiring.[125][126] The mechanics on the tarmac saw something fall out of the plane.[127] It was the
                portside engine, or a part of it, and the propeller.[127][125] The plane swung wildly to the right and
                plummeted, crashing, breaking into two, and exploding into flames.[127][125] Inside, the chief pilot,
                copilot and Lieutenant-General Tsunamasa Shidei, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army,
                who was to have made the negotiations for Bose with the Soviet army in Manchuria,[128] were instantly
                killed.[127][129] Bose's assistant Habibur Rahman was stunned, passing out briefly, and Bose, although
                conscious and not fatally hurt, was soaked in gasoline. When Rahman came to, he and Bose attempted to
                leave by the rear door, but found it blocked by the luggage.[129] They then decided to run through the
                flames and exit from the front.[129] The ground staff, now approaching the plane, saw two people
                staggering towards them, one of whom had become a human torch.[127] The human torch turned out to be
                Bose, whose gasoline-soaked clothes had instantly ignited.[129] Rahman and a few others managed to
                smother the flames, but also noticed that Bose's face and head appeared badly burned.[129] According to
                Joyce Chapman Lebra, "A truck which served as ambulance rushed Bose and the other passengers to the

            <h1>Ideology</h1>
            <p>Bose believed that authoritarianism could bring liberation and reconstruction of Indian society.[143] He
                expressed admiration for the authoritarian methods which he saw in Italy and Germany during the 1930s;
                he thought they could be used to build an independent India.[101]

                To a large number of Congress leaders, Bose programme shared enough similarities with Japanese
                fascists.[144] After getting marginalized within Congress, Bose chose to embrace fascist regimes as
                allies against the British and fled India.[49][145] Bose believed that India "must have a political
                system—State—of an authoritarian character," and "a strong central government with dictatorial powers
                for some years to come".[146]

                Earlier, Bose had clearly expressed his belief that democracy was the best option for India.[147]
                However, during the war (and possibly as early as the 1930s), Bose seems to have decided that no
                democratic system could be adequate to overcome India's poverty and social inequalities, and he wrote
                that a socialist state similar to that of Soviet Russia (which he had also seen and admired) would be
                needed for the process of national re-building.[an][148] Accordingly, some suggest that Bose's alliance
                with the Axis during the war was based on more than just pragmatism and that Bose was a militant
                nationalist, though not a Nazi nor a Fascist, for he supported the empowerment of women, secularism and
                other liberal ideas; alternatively, others consider he might have been using populist methods of
                mobilisation common to many post-colonial leaders.Since before the beginning of the World War II, Bose
                was opposed to the attempts to grant Jewish refugees asylum in India.[149][150] The great anti-Jewish
                pogrom called “the Night of Broken Glass” happened on 9 November 1938. In early December, the pro-Hindu
                Mahasabha journals published articles lending support to German anti-Semitism. This stance brought Hindu
                Mahasabha into conflict with the Congress which, on 12 December, issued statement containing references
                to recent European events.
                In 1938, Bose had denounced Nazi racial policy and persecution of Jews.[156] However, in 1942 he had
                published an article in the journal Angriff, where he wrote that Indians were true Aryans and the
                'brethren' of the Germans. Bose added that Swastika (symbol of Nazi Germany) was an ancient Indian
                symbol. Bose urged that anti-Semitism should be part of Indian liberation movement because the Jews
                assisted the British to exploit Indians.[157] The Jewish Chronicle had condemned Bose as "India's
                anti-Jewish Quisling" over this article.</p>
